Incident Report: JWT Pizza Database Foreign Key Constraint Failure - April 8, 2025

Summary
My JWT Pizza service experienced a huge database issue causing foreign key constraint violations between the franchise and store tables. It prevented the creation of new stores and resulted in a lot of orders to the website failing to go through. The incident was eventually resolved by accessing a specific repair URL that was embedded in the error messages returned by the system.

Detection
The incident was detected through monitoring alerts showing lots of increased latency and failed API calls. Specifically, attempts to create stores were failing with foreign key constraint errors and order processing was also affected. The system was logging multiple errors related to database integrity issues.

Impact
•	Service Impact: Users were unable to create new stores or place orders successfully
•	Error Rate: 100% failure rate for store creation and order processing
•	Duration: Approximately 4 hours from initial detection to resolution

Timeline
•	10:30 - Initial alerts triggered showing increased API failure rates
•	10:37 - Investigation begun into database errors
•	1:10 - Foreign key constraint failures identified between franchise and store tables
•	Initially, it was around this time that I misdiagnosed the problem and thought that I had found a solution.
•	2:20 - Error logs revealed a fix URL in the "reportPizzaCreationErrorToPizzaFactoryUrl" field
•	2:20 - Resolution implemented by accessing the provided fix URL
•	2:21 - Service functionality verified and confirmed as restored

Root Cause Analysis
The root cause was a database integrity issue where references between the franchise and store tables were corrupted. Specifically, attempts to create stores were failing with the error: "Cannot add or update a child row. This indicated that my system was attempting to create stores that were referencing franchise IDS that didn’t exist, which caused the integrity of the system to prevent the operations due to it not having enough resources.

Resolution
The issue was resolved by navigating to a repair URL that was embedded in the error responses:
https://cs329.cs.byu.edu/api/report?apiKey=4f99ef7c76114c0fb9222760a56dda35&fixCode=ead1947f93f74518809127bf6000ae17
This URL contained a fix code specific to this chaos testing scenario and triggered a database repair operation that restored the relationship between the franchise and store tables.

Prevention
To prevent similar issues in the future I think I would add enhanced error handling to better deal with the database constraint violations. I would also add some sort of automatic recovery mechanism that can detect and resolve issues like this without manual intervention in the future. I would also set up enhanced monitoring, particularly surrounding foreign key constraint violations.

Action Items
1.	Implement database health check endpoints that can verify referential integrity
2.	Add specific monitoring for database constraint violations
3.	Create automated recovery procedures for common database integrity issues
4.	Improve error messages to more clearly indicate resolution steps
5.	Add alerts specifically designed to detect this type of failure quickly

Lessons Learned
This incident highlighted the importance of good error logging and having the ability to debug. I think that maintaining proper database integrity is essential to any business and so having something like this happen can crumble it from the inside. I also think it’s important to have lots and lots of metrics so if a single thing starts acting weird, you know exactly what the problem is, and you don’t need to do anything to solve it. Most importantly though, I think having the systems in place to deal with these problems is the most important. If you are never notified of a potential change in your system, it’s over.
