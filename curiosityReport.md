DevOps Practices at CRISPR Therapeutics

One of the top gene editing businesses, CRISPR Therapeutics, uses CRISPR-Cas9 technology to create medications for severe illnesses that people have been dealing with through generations. Large-scale, effective gene sequencing is a vital component of their research and development process. To achieve their efficiency and replicability, CRISPR Therapeutics applies several of the DevOps techniques we have discussed in class to improve the flexibility, automation, and dependability of its sequencing processes.
With the help of the ground-breaking gene editing technology CRISPR, researchers can accurately change DNA sequences. To enable targeted genetic alterations, scientists essentially utilize an RNA strand that instructs the Cas9 enzyme to cut DNA at a certain spot. Researchers must look at the entire genome of a person and target their specific genetic mutations to create CRISPR-based treatments that work. This entails figuring out their entire DNA sequence. Though they can swiftly read billions of DNA fragments in parallel, next-generation sequencing (NGS) devices produce terabytes of raw data that need to be processed and examined. It's crucial to do this effectively and economically, which is where the DevOps comes in. 

Some of the ways DevOps can be used include:
1.	Automation: Using programs like Snakemake and WDL, they have automated every step of the genome sequencing process, from sample preparation to data processing and analysis. This lowers the possibility of inaccuracy and manual labor and ensures the correct results the first time.
2.	Cloud Infrastructure: Sequencing workloads can readily scale computation and storage resources as needed because they are hosted on the AWS cloud.
3.	Containerization: Docker containers are used to bundle bioinformatics tools and software environments, while Kubernetes is used to orchestrate them. This guarantees portability and reproducibility. 
4.	CI/CD: AWS Code Build is used to establish automated build, test, and deployment pipelines. Faster and more dependable results are made possible by this.
5.	Monitoring: Prometheus and Grafana are two tools that are utilized to allow for real-time monitoring of sequencing runs and pipeline activities, which facilitates prompt problem identification and resolution within CRISPR’s testing and research phase.

Throughout their lifespan, embracing DevOps has allowed CRISPR Therapeutics to increase sequencing throughput, reduce costs, and accelerate their R&D timelines. Their usage of pipelines is especially useful. CRISPR’s raw sequencing data is produced using Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencers. Using tools like BWA, GATK, and VEP, they process the raw data through an automated bioinformatics pipeline defined with Snakemake. The processed data is then put into an AWS S3 data lake that is based on Hadoop. For downstream analysis, Hail, Spark, and Jupyter notebooks are utilized, and then R Shiny web apps are used to visualize the results. Using EC2 instances for computation, S3 for storage, and services like Batch, Glue, and EMR, the entire platform is powered by AWS, which streamlines the process and keeps the data neat and organized for the researchers.

Overall, I think there are many different amazing ways to utilize DevOps, but I think some of the most important are:
1.	Containerize everything possible for maximum reproducibility, ensuring that if somebody picks up the task after you, they will be able to reproduce it with minimal effort.
2.	Treat acquired data as code. Researchers often document the version that was used, and review their datasets like application code, walking through it as they perform the processes.
3.	Implement end-to-end monitoring and observability from the beginning to end, ensuring that nothing is lost in the process.
4.	Work closely with your coworkers, in this case, research scientists, to understand the requirements for your code and potential pain points that they may want to avoid. Pipelines are best used when they cause the least amount of suffering in the long run, and if you can’t construct a good one, you’re going to cause a lot of problems in R&D.

Applying DevOps in an environment with complex biotech poses unique challenges. The problem is that bioinformatic tools often expect very specific environments and can behave unexpectedly. Data security and compliance requirements then add further complexity. However, I believe that in the long run, DevOps and streamlining processes are almost always the best, most efficient ways of producing replicable results. CRISPR Therapeutics has created a very effective and scalable gene sequencing platform by adopting DevOps techniques, which allows for quicker iterations on CRISPR-based treatments. Increasing throughput while keeping expenses under control has been made possible by their stellar automation, cloud infrastructure, and containerization. Even while there are still obstacles to overcome, their experience shows how DevOps can spur innovation in a complex field like genomics and sequencing research. I believe that continuing to utilize it in the future will make the industry not only more efficient, but innovative.
